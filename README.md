[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/bible-ai-prompting-class/blob/main/bible_ai_prompting_masterclass_NIV_expanded.ipynb)

Learn AI prompt engineering through Bible study — NIV edition with lessons, examples, and an expanded prompt library.


This project is an **interactive Colab notebook** that teaches you how to study the Bible with AI **using the New International Version (NIV)** as the reference tone and wording.

You'll learn **7 practical prompting techniques** while exploring Scripture, from simple explanations to deep theological comparisons.

## 💖 Why I Built This
As both a technologist and a follower of Christ, I believe our skills are gifts meant to serve others.  
This project is my way of showing how modern tools like AI can deepen our understanding of God’s Word and help us share it creatively.

By combining **prompt engineering** with **Bible study**, I hope to inspire others to:
- Approach Scripture with curiosity and clarity
- See technology as a tool for ministry, not a replacement for relationship
- Explore their faith in a way that’s engaging, thoughtful, and practical

Whether you’re here for the coding or the content, my prayer is that you leave encouraged and equipped.
